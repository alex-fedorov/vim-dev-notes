# Developer Notes Vim Plugin

Allows you to create notes on lines of code

## Setup

Run this to clone it as a submodule (or use your preferred way to install vim plugins):

```
cd .vim
git submodule add https://github.com/alex-fedorov/vim-dev-notes.git bundle/vim-dev-notes
```

To open a dev note for specific line of code type in normal mode `:Note`.

You may want to map it to some key in your vimrc, for example:

```
nmap <F1> :Note<cr>
```

or to be more precise (if you have already `Note` command from other plugin(s)):

```
nmap <F5> :call dev_notes#note()<cr>
```
